* mother_marital_status – is mother married? (1 = Yes, 2 = No)
* mother_delivery_weight – mother’s weight at delivery in pounds
* mother_race – race of the mother (1 = White (alone); 2 = Black (alone); 3 = AIAN (alone); 4 Asian (alone); 5 = NHOPI (alone); 6 = More than one race)
* mother_height – height of the mother in inches
* mother_weight_gain – mother’s weight gain during the pregnancy (in pounds)
* father_age – age of the father

* cigarettes_before_pregnancy – number of cigarettes smoked daily by the mother before pregnancy (00-97 = number of cigarettes daily, 98 = 98 or more cigarettes daily)
* prenatal_care_month – pregnancy month in which prenatal care began (99 = no prenatal care)
